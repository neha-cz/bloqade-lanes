Bloqade is a Python SDK for neutral atom quantum computing. It provides a set of embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) for programming neutral atom quantum computers. Bloqade is designed to be a high-level, user-friendly SDK that abstracts away the complexities of neutral atom quantum computing, allowing users to focus on developing quantum algorithms and compilation strategies for neutral atom quantum computers.

Bloqade-lanes provides the core components for compiling neutral atom quantum circuit programs down to moves. It focuses on the physical layout and movement of atoms along fixed lanes in a neutral atom quantum processor.

## Changes made so far
- Added a constraint for the minimum Chebyshev distance between entangled pairs on the AOD grid.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This project is in the early stage of development. API and features are subject to change.

## Installation

### Install via `uv` (Recommended)

```py
uv add bloqade-lanes
